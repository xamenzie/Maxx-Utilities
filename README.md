## Switch Pivot Point

Let you switch between Median Point & 3D Cursor with a simple click

## Quick render settings

### High Res preset

  - Set the device to GPU
  - Set adaptive sampling with a threshold at 0.01 and 1000 samples
  - Activate Open image denoise in the render
  - Set appropriate lights bounces
  - Activate persitent data

### Low Res preset

  - Set the device to GPU
  - Set adaptive sampling with a threshold at 0.02 and 600 samples
  - Activate Open image denoise in the render
  - Set appropriate lights bounces
  - Activate persitent data

### EXR Output

  - Set output to EXR multilayer, DWAA 32 bits
  - Set the cryptomatte

### PNG Output

  - Set output to PNG 16 bits RGBA

## Basic Collections structure

Create basic collection strucure to keep organised. It presents with this tree structure :

__ Scene<br>
__ Rendering<br>
_____ Lights<br>
_____ Cam<br>
